# CodingChallange
My 12 months coding challange
Starting on 15th of February 2018

# Resolutions
1. Make at least 1 commit everyday to sum up minimum 1 hour learning effort.
2. To have fun!


# Important phrases noticed during learning:

1. There are some named properties in arrays, such as length and a number
of methods. Methods are functions that live in properties and (usually)
act on the value they are a property of.
2. (It’s a bit silly that we have to define plus as a function, but operators
in JavaScript, unlike functions, are not values, so you can’t pass them
as arguments.)
