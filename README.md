# CodingChallange
My 12 months coding challange
Starting on 15th of February 2018

# Resolutions
1. Make at least 1 commit everyday to sum up minimum 1 hour learning effort.
2. To have fun!


# Important phrases noticed during learning:

1. There are some named properties in arrays, such as length and a number
of methods. Methods are functions that live in properties and (usually)
act on the value they are a property of.
2. (It’s a bit silly that we have to define plus as a function, but operators
in JavaScript, unlike functions, are not values, so you can’t pass them
as arguments.)
3. Usually a method needs to do something with the object it was called
on. When a function is called as a method—looked up as a property and
immediately called, as in object.method()—the special variable this in its
body will point to the object that it was called on.
4. In addition to their set of properties,
almost all objects also have a prototype. A prototype is another object
that is used as a fallback source of properties.
